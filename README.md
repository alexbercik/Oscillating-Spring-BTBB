# Oscillating-Spring-BTBB
The code used in in the following Youtube video: TBD
This uses two simple methods to solve the ODE y''= -(k/m)*y -g which corresponds to a mass oscillating on a spring without damping. The Explicit Euler method is demonstrated to be unstable, while  modified Euler method remains stable for all time.
